IIn addition, new code has been developed by Kiyoshi Ikuma to improve the convergence properties of the RCWA method. This includes optimizations not present in the original implementation. These improvements were made with reference to the techniques described in the book *Pythonを使った光電磁場解析* by **Kotarou Kajikawa** and **Takayuki Okamoto**, published by **Corona Publishing Co., Ltd.**, 2019.
